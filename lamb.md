# Lamb
[Lamb](https://github.com/HKGx/lamb) is a still WIP bot project that I have to "finish".
It's meant for [a discord server](https://discord.gg/B4eqskz).


It'll be mostly utility bot as it was firsly thought to help with #selfies channel.

I'm still far far away from finishing it. I still have to design the toolchain that'll allow me for quick deployment of new features [[csharp-deployment-chain]].


## Current features
- ability to lose some coins on charity tokens

## Planned features
- somewhat automated way to manage #selfeies


[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[csharp-deployment-chain]: csharp-deployment-chain "C# Deployment Chain"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
